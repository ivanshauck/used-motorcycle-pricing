# used-motorcycle-pricing
A model that estimates used motorcycle price given certain inputted specifications. The model was trained with data scraped from craigslist.
For this project I used motorcycle make, model, age, odometer reading, city being sold in, title status, transmission type, fuel used, paint color, and type as my features. The categorical variables were all label encoded. Missing values for categorical variables were filled using the mode from each column. Odometer reading missing values were filled with the mean from each column, and engine displacement missing values were filled with the mean value for the type of motorcycle.
I tried a random forest, a gradient boosting regressor, and a KNN regressor, the random forest performed best ultimately with an R squared of .87, a mean squared absolute percentage error of about 14%, and a median absolute percentage error of 8%. The final dataset for the model contained 12,532 rows, and 18 features, 3 of which were artificial interaction features. Motorcycles listed at 3,000$ or below were not included in the model as the random forest was comitting egregious errors with these lower priced motorcycles. The model was also only used on 19 different manufacturers, namely those that had a representation of 50 rows or more in the dataset.
